[{"Key":"X4 Management?","Content":"In x4, the player has their own avatar and first person experience, however they also manage an empire of activities. \nThese include: \n- buying ships\n- setting ship behaviours\n  - trade\n  - patrol\n  - protect\n- buying stations\n - set station trade\n\nI think this would translate well to a fantasy context. \nInstead of ships, hire NPC's. Maybe even hire guilds / mercenaries? (aka multiple people in a single purchase to command as a single entity)\nInstead of trade ships, buy caravans\nInstead of patrol / protect ships, buy guards and adventurers\nInstead of stations, buy or construct towns\n\nWe can then add more fantasy items such as farming, building, forming groups / armies. \n\nFun!"}]
